      <p>
      Hi I'm Brooks! I am a recent college graduate from Boston University and have a bachelor's degree in
            Economics. I've taken up coding and web development as I see it as a cutting-edge field for the next 25
            years, and somehow I've figured out how to say 'Hello World' and a few more things along the way.
